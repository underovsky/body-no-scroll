# Body no-scroll
Sometimes you are so annoyed with browsers non-standard behaviours that you write a JS plugin. This simple piece of code blocks the scrolling of body while opening modals or overlays. It also saves scroll position.

## Use
Include the plugin file. To turn no-scroll on/off use these methods.

```
BNF.on(); // I just opened a modal and want background to be non-scrollable
BNF.off(); // Okay, back to standard view
```

## Browser support
Not tested everywhere yet. Just hold your horses for now. I will update this project in the next few days.
